# Schedule Management System - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The user has a Student Worker Schedule HTML application that uses a hybrid state tracking system for data persistence. The application allows scheduling student workers across different time slots and days, with features for saving/loading schedules, exporting to PDF, and managing student data.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Missing loadSchedule function**: The "Load" button was calling a non-existent `loadSchedule()` function, causing runtime errors
2. **Data persistence issues**: Potential for removed students to reappear due to fallback mechanisms
3. **PDF export reliability**: Dependencies on external libraries that may fail to load
4. **Schedule data sanitization**: Need to filter out assignments for non-existent students

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create functional loadSchedule âœ… COMPLETED
- **Objective**: Fix the "Load" button functionality
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - `loadSchedule()` function exists and is callable
  - Function loads data from localStorage using hybrid system
  - Function re-renders the interface after loading
  - No runtime errors when button is clicked
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Implementation**: Created `loadSchedule()` function that calls `loadHybridSchedule()` and re-renders the interface

### Task 2: Filter schedule for nonexistent students on init âœ… COMPLETED
- **Objective**: Prevent removed students from reappearing by sanitizing stored schedule data
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Schedule data is filtered against current people list during initialization
  - Assignments for removed students are purged from storage
  - No orphaned schedule entries remain
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Implementation**: Created `sanitizeScheduleData()` function that filters schedule entries against current people list and removes assignments for non-existent students

### Task 3: Ensure PDF export dependencies are loaded
- **Objective**: Make PDF export more reliable by ensuring required libraries are loaded
- **Success Criteria**:
  - jsPDF and html2canvas libraries are verified before export
  - Graceful fallback if libraries fail to load
  - Clear error messages for users
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ PENDING

## Project Status Board

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Remove "Load Schedule" button (original request)
- [x] Make "Save Schedule" button purple
- [x] Re-add "Load" button
- [x] Make "Load" button orange
- [x] Move "Load" button to right of "Quick Save" button
- [x] Create functional loadSchedule function
- [x] Filter schedule for nonexistent students on init

### Current Tasks
- [ ] Ensure PDF export dependencies are loaded

### Future Tasks
- [ ] Additional UI improvements as requested
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Enhanced error handling

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Current Phase**: Task 2 completed, ready to proceed to Task 3

**Latest Update**: Successfully implemented schedule data sanitization. The `sanitizeScheduleData()` function:
- Filters schedule entries against the current people list during initialization
- Removes assignments for students who no longer exist in the people list
- Provides detailed logging of the sanitization process
- Prevents orphaned schedule entries from reappearing after student removal

**Next Steps**: Address Task 3 - ensuring PDF export dependencies are loaded reliably.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Task 2 Completion Report**:
- âœ… Successfully created `sanitizeScheduleData()` function
- âœ… Function filters schedule entries against current people list during initialization
- âœ… Removes assignments for non-existent students to prevent orphaned entries
- âœ… Provides comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- âœ… Integrated into `initializeSchedule()` workflow after people list is loaded

**Ready for Task 3**: The next task involves ensuring PDF export dependencies (jsPDF and html2canvas) are loaded reliably before the export feature is used. This will require examining the PDF export function and adding dependency verification logic.

## Lessons
- Always verify function existence before implementing UI elements that call them
- The hybrid state tracking system provides robust data persistence with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Error handling should include both console logging and user-facing alerts for better debugging
- Integration with existing systems (like `loadHybridSchedule()`) is more reliable than creating entirely new implementations
- Schedule data sanitization should be performed after loading both schedule and people data to ensure consistency
- Parsing schedule keys requires understanding the specific format (day-slot-studentCode) to extract student codes correctly
- Comprehensive logging during data sanitization helps with debugging and monitoring data integrity
