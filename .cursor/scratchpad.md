# Student Worker Schedule - Project Planning & Analysis

## Background and Motivation

The Student Worker Schedule is a single-file HTML application used for managing lab worker schedules. The application is used infrequently (only a couple weeks per year) but is critical when in use. The current application is functional but loses all data when the browser is closed, which is a significant pain point for users.

**Key Requirements:**
- Must remain a single HTML file
- Used in academic/lab environment
- Infrequent but critical use
- Non-technical user base
- Must be portable and shareable

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current State Analysis
- **File Size**: 176KB, 1634 lines - quite large for a single file
- **External Dependencies**: Uses CDN libraries (jsPDF, html2canvas, jspdf-autotable)
- **Data Loss**: No persistence - all work lost on browser close
- **Architecture**: Vanilla JavaScript with CSS Grid layout
- **User Interface**: Color-coded schedule grid with drag-and-drop functionality

### Research-Based Insights
Based on the Single-File HTML App Research document:

1. **localStorage vs IndexedDB**: For this use case, localStorage is ideal:
   - Simple key-value store, easy to implement
   - 5-10MB storage limit (more than sufficient for schedule data)
   - Synchronous API, good for small datasets
   - Perfect for "vanilla JS" approach

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Current file size (176KB) is acceptable for infrequent use
   - Minification could reduce size by 30-50%
   - Lazy loading of PDF libraries would improve initial load time

3. **Architecture Pattern**: "Vanilla JS" approach is recommended:
   - Good performance (no framework overhead)
   - Moderate developer experience
   - Good for interactive tools and simple business applications

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Current Questions/Decisions Needed
1. **Implementation Approach**: ✅ DECIDED - Hybrid approach (event-driven state tracking + DOM verification)
2. **Data Structure**: ✅ DECIDED - JSON structure with tracked state and DOM verification backup
3. **User Interface**: ✅ DECIDED - No visual indicators needed for auto-saving (keep it invisible to users)

### Task 1 Completion Report
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation Details**:
- Added comprehensive state tracking system with `stateTracker` object
- Implemented hybrid data structure with `hybridData` object containing tracked state and DOM verification
- Created event-driven auto-save system with debouncing (500ms)
- Added MutationObserver to detect DOM changes automatically
- Implemented checksum generation for data integrity
- Updated existing functions to use hybrid system
- Added console logging for debugging and monitoring

**Key Functions Added**:
- `initializeStateTracking()` - Sets up the entire state tracking system
- `setupAutoSaveListeners()` - Configures MutationObserver for DOM change detection
- `queueAutoSave()` - Debounced auto-save queue system
- `performAutoSave()` - Executes the actual auto-save operation
- `updateTrackedState()` - Updates the tracked state with current schedule data
- `captureCurrentAssignments()` - DOM verification backup system
- `generateChecksum()` - Data integrity verification
- `loadHybridSchedule()` - Hybrid loading system with fallbacks
- `saveHybridSchedule()` - Hybrid saving system with error handling

**Testing Status**: File opens successfully in browser, no console errors detected
**Next Steps**: Proceed with Task 2 - enhance the `captureCurrentAssignments()` function for better DOM verification reliability

### Technical Considerations
- **localStorage Key**: Use 'labSchedule' as the storage key
- **Data Format**: Hybrid JSON structure with tracked state and DOM verification backup
- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks for localStorage failures
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Implementation Strategy**: Event-driven updates for performance, DOM capture for reliability

### Implementation Notes

- Document any changes for future maintenance
- Use hybrid approach: event-driven for performance, DOM verification for reliability
- Export as self-contained HTML files (not separate JSON files)
