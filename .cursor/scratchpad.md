# PDF Resolution Improvement Project

## Background and Motivation
User reported poor PDF print quality from the Student Worker Schedule Template. Analysis shows the issue is low resolution due to html2canvas using scale: 1.0 (equivalent to 72 DPI). User wants maximum quality regardless of file size.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
✅ **COMPLETED:** Planner analysis - identified root cause as low scale parameter  
✅ **COMPLETED:** Executor implementation - both scale parameters updated to 3.0  
✅ **COMPLETED:** Code validation - no linting errors introduced  
⏳ **PENDING:** User testing and validation of improved PDF quality

## Executor's Current Task
Implementing Option 1 from Planner analysis:
- Change html2canvas scale parameter from 1.0 to 3.0 
- Apply to both PDF export canvas captures (schedule grid and totals table)
- Expected result: 3x resolution improvement (equivalent to ~216 DPI)

## Technical Details
- **Target files:** Student Worker Schedule Template.html
- **Target function:** exportToPDF() starting line ~1725
- **Parameters to modify:**
  - Line ~1825: scale: 1.0 → scale: 3.0 (schedule container)  
  - Line ~1849: scale: 1.0 → scale: 3.0 (totals container)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Both html2canvas calls updated to scale: 3.0
- [x] PDF export function maintains all other functionality  
- [x] No linting errors introduced
- [ ] User validates improved PDF quality for printing

## Lessons
- html2canvas scale parameter directly controls image resolution for PDF generation
- scale: 1.0 = 72 DPI equivalent (poor for printing)
- scale: 3.0 = 216 DPI equivalent (excellent for printing)
